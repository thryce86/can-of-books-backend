		Logistical
What hours will you be available to communicate?
Stanley - 1 - 6pm   pst 
Chad  -	  3 - 8pn   cst 

What platform will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?
-Slack also Remo.


How often will you take breaks?

Every hour.

What is your plan if you start to fall behind?

Get TA help if we still have problems escalate to teacher.





		Cooperative
Make a list of each parson’s strengths.

-  Stanley - Backend and CSS.  

-  Chad - backend as well. 




How can you best utilize these strengths in the development of your application?

Stanley prioritizes  the frontend and Chad focuses on the back end. 





In what areas do you each want to develop greater strength?

Communication , teambuilding, and attaining project milestones in a remote work enviroment.




Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development?

Review code tasks, come up with a plan to complete them, write down the methods and variables needed for the front and backend to communicate, 
if time allows integrate the components to ensure program is functioning properly. 





		Conflict Resolution

What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing?

Talk it thru the conflict and if we can not resolve the issue escalate it to the instructors. 



What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute?

Same as above but focus more on splitting up tasks.


How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?

If one of us has questions simply ask if one of us is more skilled in a particular area then they can guide the other so that the project does not become polarized.  IE one 
participant races ahead and the other doesn't finish because that would be a waste of the groups limited time.
